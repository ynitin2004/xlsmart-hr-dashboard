## Analyses Better Delivered by Classical AI

### **High-Impact Analyses** (Immediate Benefits)

#### 1. **Skills Gap Analysis**
**Current**: GPT-4 generates narrative assessments
**Classical AI**: Mathematical gap calculation
- **Formula**: Gap Score = (Required Level - Current Level) × Skill Weight
- **Benefits**: Exact calculations, consistent results, instant processing
- **Why Better**: Skills assessment needs precision, not creativity

#### 2. **Employee-Role Matching**
**Current**: GPT-4 analyzes profiles subjectively
**Classical AI**: Multi-criteria scoring algorithm
- **Formula**: Match Score = (Skills × 0.4) + (Experience × 0.3) + (Department × 0.2) + (Level × 0.1)
- **Benefits**: Transparent scoring, no bias, 100x faster
- **Why Better**: Matching needs objectivity, not interpretation

#### 3. **Compensation Analysis**
**Current**: GPT-4 provides market insights
**Classical AI**: Statistical regression models
- **Models**: Linear regression, market benchmarking, percentile analysis
- **Benefits**: Data-driven predictions, industry-standard methods
- **Why Better**: Salary analysis needs statistical rigor, not narrative

#### 4. **Diversity Metrics Analysis**
**Current**: GPT-4 interprets diversity data
**Classical AI**: Statistical hypothesis testing
- **Tests**: Chi-square tests, t-tests, representation ratios
- **Benefits**: Compliance-ready, objective measurements
- **Why Better**: Diversity analysis needs statistical validity

#### 5. **Text Similarity Matching**
**Current**: GPT-4 compares documents
**Classical AI**: TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity
- **Algorithm**: Vector-based similarity scoring
- **Benefits**: Mathematical precision, consistent results
- **Why Better**: Document comparison needs exact similarity scores

### **Medium-Impact Analyses** (Enhanced Performance)

#### 6. **Bulk Data Processing**
**Current**: GPT-4 processes datasets sequentially
**Classical AI**: Parallel statistical analysis
- **Methods**: Clustering, classification, regression
- **Benefits**: Handles any dataset size, near-zero cost
- **Why Better**: Large datasets need computational efficiency

#### 7. **Career Path Analysis**
**Current**: GPT-4 generates narrative paths
**Classical AI**: Graph algorithm pathfinding
- **Algorithm**: Dijkstra's algorithm for optimal paths
- **Benefits**: Based on actual progression data, real-time calculation
- **Why Better**: Career paths need data-driven optimization

#### 8. **Workforce Analytics**
**Current**: GPT-4 identifies patterns
**Classical AI**: Statistical modeling
- **Models**: Regression, time-series analysis, clustering
- **Benefits**: Data-driven insights, predictive modeling
- **Why Better**: Analytics need statistical rigor, not interpretation

## Analyses That Should Keep GenAI

### **Creative & Narrative Analyses** (Keep GenAI)
1. **Job Description Optimization** - Creative writing and improvement
2. **Employee Engagement Analysis** - Sentiment interpretation and insights
3. **Succession Planning** - Complex reasoning about leadership potential
4. **Learning & Development Recommendations** - Personalized learning narratives
5. **Chat & Q&A Systems** - Natural language understanding needed
6. **Role Standardization Descriptions** - Creative role descriptions

### **Why These Keep GenAI:**
- **Need creativity** and natural language generation
- **Require interpretation** of complex human factors
- **Benefit from narrative** explanations and insights
- **Involve subjective** judgment and reasoning
